"I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed." -SwampCowboy.eth

Swamp Cowboy is a simple buy bot that executes functions on smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain and ETH Layer-2's. There is no AI, there is no manual manipulation. It's simply a series of smart contracts with simple functions that execute scheduled market buys on tokens and a scheduled transfer of those tokens to wherever projects want them sent according to their whitepaper. Everything is open-source code and fully transparent. Schedules for the automation of these functions are fully disclosed by the project and not changed unless the community is fully notified in writing 7 days in advance of changes.

Swamp Cowboy operates out of the Central Florida Swamp and is set up by [Drew Roberts](https://DrewRoberts.com) and his team of developers. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Drew Roberts through one of the following:
